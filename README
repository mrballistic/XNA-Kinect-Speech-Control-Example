Quick and dirty demo that takes the original Kinect Speech demo and ports it to XNA. With that, we get animation for free, which is how it tweens the color offsets based upon user input.

As with all Speech + Kinect demos, this requires:

1. a Kinect
2. Visual Studio
3. Kinect SDK 1.0
4. Microsoft Speech SDK and runtimes (x86) v11

While it's running, say "Red", "Green", "Blue", or "Clear" to change the camera view.

Enjoy!
