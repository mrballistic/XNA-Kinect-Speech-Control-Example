XNA Kinect Speech Control Demo
==============================

Quick and dirty demo that takes the original Kinect Speech demo and ports it to XNA. With that, we get animation for free, which is how it tweens the color offsets based upon user input.

As with all Speech + Kinect demos, this requires:

1. a Kinect
2. Visual Studio 2010
3. Kinect SDK 1.6
4. Microsoft Speech SDK and runtimes (x86) v11
5. XNA Studio 4.0

This latest version was updated to work under Visual Studio 2010/Windows 8 and the latest Kinect SDK (1.6). Getting XNA Studio to install under windows 8 is a bit of a chore. If you run into trouble, try installing Games For Windows first, then try again. If Microsoft updates XNA Studio for Windows 8, I'll update this, too.

How to play with it
===================

While it's running, say "Red", "Green", "Blue", or "Clear" to change the camera view.

Enjoy!
